Recording the process of running Anlogic Tang Dynasty (TD) on Apple Silicon through UTM.

## 1. Preparation

Before starting, make sure you have already installed UTM and installed a debian with Rosetta
support referencing this [guide](https://docs.getutm.app/guides/debian).

After following the guide, you should have Rosetta support in your UTM Debian VM, which can be
verified by:

```sh
debian@debian-sid:~$ cat /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/rosetta
enabled
interpreter /media/rosetta/rosetta
flags: POCF
offset 0
magic 7f454c4602010100000000000000000002003e00
mask fffffffffffefe00fffffffffffffffffeffffff
```

## 2. Install Anlogic TD

You should download the Anlogic TD from https://www.anlogic.com/ to your VM, and unzip it.

When you try to run the `bin/td.sh` script, you should get errors.

Now, let's install the dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt install libc6:amd64 libgtk2.0-0:amd64 \
    libsm6:amd64 libxcb-glx0:amd64 \
    libx11-xcb1:amd64 libgl1:amd64
```

## 3. Run Anlogic TD

Now, you can run the `td.sh` script and it should work.

```sh
debian@debian-sid:~/Tools/TD_5.6.5_SP3_151449_NL$ ./bin/td.sh
