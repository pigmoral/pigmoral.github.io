I found that when I exit from a SSH session on my server, the server running in
Podman becomes invalid.

After searching, I found that this is because the Podman containers are started
by normal users, and systemd loginctl will kill user processes when the users
logout.

To check, run:
```sh
$ loginctl list-users
```

and I got this:
```sh
 UID USER     LINGER
1000 pigmoral no

1 users listed.
```

To fix this, we can enable the linger for the user, which will take care of the
user processes when the user logs out:
```sh
$ loginctl enable-linger [USER...]
```

Run `loginctl list-users` again:
```sh
 UID USER     LINGER
1000 pigmoral yes

1 users listed.
```

You can now quit without worrying about your containers.
